This project was made for Project 5 of Udacity's Front End Web Development Nanodegree.

This website demonstrates interaction with the Google Maps API, the Yelp API, and the Knockout JS framework.  The seaerch box allows zip code and search term input which searches Yelp.  The user can then filter the results by minimum yelp rating.  

To Use the website:

Enter the zip code and search term into the input fields.  Hit search to see results.  You may also select Filter By Rating to expand a menu that gives further result filtering options.  Upon success, the website will display markers indicating results of the search.  Select a marker to see detailed information as well as a hyperlink to the specific Yelp page for the location.   The user may also select items in the list view that populuates beneath the input window. The input window and list view window can be temporarily dismissed by clicking the X icon in the upper right corner of the views.  Select the Search button to restore the views.  

Easter Egg:  When viewing the website using a mobile device, an additional option appears in the bottom right corner, demonstrating an additional API call.
