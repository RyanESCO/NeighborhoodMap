This project was made for Project 5 of Udacity's Front End Web Development Nanodegree.

This website demonstrates interaction with the Google Maps API, the Yelp API, and the Knockout JS framework.  The seaerch box allows zip code and search term input which searches Yelp.  The user can then filter the results by minimum yelp rating.
